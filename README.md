# ShopNow-theme-switcher-
Built a React-based web application with a theme switcher. The switcher should allow users to select from three distinct themes (Theme 1, Theme 2, Theme 3) using a dropdown in the header. Each theme should not only change colors, but also alter structure, fonts, spacing, and layout.
